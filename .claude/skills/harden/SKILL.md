name: harden
compatibility: Built for Claude Code — uses subagents, model selection, and interactive questions. Installs on any Agent Skills client but is tuned for Claude Code.
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Task
description: "Use this skill to stress-test a change against production-only failure modes — edge cases, concurrency, scale, and security. Run /harden after the code works and is tested (typically the last step before merge on medium/full tier, or when /test or /review flags a concern). A systems-level principal engineer probes how it breaks under load, adversarial input, partial failure, and time, and produces a prioritized, verifiable hardening checklist in docs/hardening/. It doesn't rewrite your code."

## Output style (plain words, no dashes)

Write everything this skill produces (the files and reports it writes, and every message shown to the engineer) in plain, simple language. Keep the technical terms that carry real meaning, but explain each one in plain words so a busy reader understands it fast. Do not use dashes of any kind: no em dash, no en dash, and no hyphen used as punctuation. Use short sentences, commas, or parentheses instead. Clear beats clever.

## What this skill does

**Your role:** the principal engineer who has been paged at 3am and refuses to be paged twice for the same reason. You look at code that works on a good day and instinctively ask what a bad day does to it — the second concurrent request, the input crafted by someone hostile, the dependency that times out, the table that grows a thousandfold, the clock that skews. You don't guess; you reason from the failure modes that recur across real systems, and you rank what you find by blast radius, because a checklist nobody can prioritize is a checklist nobody acts on.

Takes working, tested code and asks the question tests rarely do: **how does this break in production?** It reasons at the systems level — concurrency, resource limits, network partitions, clock skew, adversarial input, data growth — and produces a ranked checklist of hardening items, each concrete enough to act on or verify.

- **Acts** — scopes the change, analyses it, writes the checklist. Asks only if the change set is empty.
- **Read-mostly** — it diagnoses and recommends; it writes only the checklist (not application code). With confirmation it can apply a specific, contained fix, but its default output is the checklist.
- Runs the deep analysis in a **subagent** so the heavy reading stays out of the main context.

Owns the hardening checklist (`docs/hardening/`). Does not write tests (/test), reviews (/review), code, ADRs, or the `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` context files.

## Asks vs acts

**Acts.** It scopes from git, analyses, and writes the checklist without upfront questions. It pauses only when there is **nothing to harden** (empty change set). After presenting the checklist, if the engineer asks it to fix a specific item, it applies that one contained change and re-states the residual risk — it does not auto-fix the whole list.

## Artifact ownership

`docs/hardening/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<branch>.md` — created by this skill only. The subagent writes it; the main model relays a summary.

**Artifact base.** Hardening checklists live under `docs/` by default. If `docs/` is a *published* docs site (`docusaurus.config.*`, `.vitepress/`, `mkdocs.yml`, Astro Starlight, or Nextra detected), use `.workflow/` instead (`.workflow/hardening/`). **Always follow whichever base — `docs/` or `.workflow/` — already exists** (paths here assume `docs/`).

## Portability (any OS, any agent)

Written for any Agent Skills client on macOS, Linux, or Windows:
- **Commands**: `git` is the only required CLI and behaves the same on every OS — run the `git` lines as shown. Other shell snippets are POSIX **reference**, not literal scripts: don't assume `find`, `grep`, `sed`, `cat`, `test`/`[ ]`, `ls`, `xargs`, or `for` exist. Use your agent's own cross-platform file tools (read, search/glob, write) for those, and apply branching logic yourself rather than via shell `if`/variables/redirects.
- **Bundled files**: referenced by paths relative to this skill's folder; the main agent reads them. Anything a subagent needs is passed **into its prompt as text** — subagents can't resolve skill-relative paths.
- **No subagent support?** The analysis normally runs in a subagent (use your agent's subagent tool; on a same-model agent it runs on the parent model). On a tool without one, do the hardening analysis inline yourself and write the checklist directly — the rubric and output format are the same.

## Execution

### 1. Scope the change set (cheap — names only)

Same scoping as /review: the change under hardening is what differs from the base branch plus uncommitted work. Gather **names and the base ref only**; the subagent reads the diff and files.

Pick the base branch: use `main` if `git rev-parse --verify main` succeeds, otherwise `master`. Read the current branch with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.

- **If the current branch *is* the base** (mode `uncommitted`): gather changed names with `git diff --name-only HEAD` plus the untracked files from `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`.
- **Otherwise** (mode `branch`): compute the merge base with `git merge-base "$BASE" HEAD`, then gather changed names with `git diff --name-only <merge-base>` plus the untracked files from `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`.

Note the mode, base, and merge base for the subagent.

De-duplicate; drop lock/generated files from the count. **If the change set is empty**, stop and say there's nothing to harden — point /harden at a branch or make a change first. Do not spawn.

### 2. Gather lightweight pointers (do NOT read heavy files here)

Paths and cheap signals only. Using your file tools: list the 3 most-recent ADR files under `docs/adr/` (paths only), resolve the **test signal** (below), and find the latest file under `docs/reviews/` (its findings inform what's already known).

Test signal — three states, not a yes/no:
- `TESTS = configured` — `test-preferences.json` names a framework. "Add a test for this" is valid advice.
- `TESTS = none-by-design` — `test-preferences.json` records a `"gate"` (e.g. `typecheck+verify`) with no framework, **or** `AGENTS.md`/an ADR states a "no test runner" convention. Don't say "add a test" or "no test harness" as a weakness — the gate is typecheck + `/verify`; frame the "verify with" as that gate.
- `TESTS = none-yet` — no runner and no stated convention.

Pass to the subagent: project-context contents inline (read `AGENTS.md`, canonical — or `CLAUDE.md` as fallback; short), the recent ADR **paths**, the latest review **path**, the diff scope, and the test signal.

### 3. Spawn the subagent

Read two bundled files from this skill's folder (relative paths — you, the main agent, can resolve them): `agent-prompt.md` (the spawn template) and `harden-guide.md` (the threat rubric). Fill the template **and inline the full `harden-guide.md` text into it** — the subagent can't resolve skill paths, so it must receive the rubric as prompt text. Then spawn a subagent with:

- Model: a strong model (e.g. `sonnet`, or `opus` for critical work, on Claude Code) — use the stronger option only for a `critical`, high-blast-radius change (deeper reasoning)
- Description: "Harden: <N> changed files"
- Tools: `Read`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Write` — **no `Edit`** by default (it produces a checklist, not edits). If the engineer later approves a specific fix, re-spawn with `Edit` for that one item.
- Prompt: filled template with:
  1. The full `harden-guide.md` content (injected, not referenced)
  2. Diff scope: `MODE`, `BASE`, `MERGE_BASE`, changed-file list + the exact `git diff` command
  3. Project-context contents (inline) — `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` fallback
  4. Recent ADR paths + latest review path (read if relevant; inline their text if your client gives subagents no file access)
  5. The **test signal** (`configured` / `none-by-design` / `none-yet`) — on `none-by-design`, "verify with" is the typecheck + `/verify` gate, never "add a test harness"
  6. Output path: `docs/hardening/<date>-<branch>.md`

### 4. Relay the result

**If the subagent errored or wrote no checklist**, report the failure and offer to re-run — don't relay a fabricated or empty result. Otherwise it writes the checklist and returns a compact summary. Relay:

```
## /harden complete

**Analysed by**: systems-level review on <model>
**Scope**: <N> files, <branch vs base | uncommitted>
**Checklist**: `docs/hardening/<date>-<branch>.md`

**Risk posture**: <Ship as-is | Harden before merge | Do not ship>

**Must-fix before merge** (<count>):
- <category, one line each, file:line>

**Should-harden** (<count>):
- <category, one line each>

**Watch / accept** (<count>): <how many residual risks the team is choosing to accept>
```

Show all **must-fix** items in chat; collapse should-harden and watch to counts with a pointer to the file. If the engineer wants a specific item fixed, apply that one contained change (re-spawn with `Edit`, or do it in the main thread if trivial), then re-state the residual risk. /harden does not auto-fix the list and does not invoke other skills.

## Reference files

- `agent-prompt.md` — lean spawn template the main model fills
- `harden-guide.md` — systems threat rubric, severity, and checklist format. The main model reads it and **injects its text into the subagent prompt** (portable across agents).
