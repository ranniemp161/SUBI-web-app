description: "Use this skill to bootstrap a project's AI context — the AGENTS.md files every later skill reads. Run /audit at the start of a greenfield project (it asks your coding standards and seeds root AGENTS.md), on an existing codebase with no or partial docs (it scans and writes root + nested AGENTS.md, adding only what's missing), or on one named area (e.g. /audit src/auth). Writes tool-agnostic AGENTS.md plus a thin CLAUDE.md pointer; never overwrites curated content. Not for ADRs (/architect), post-change upkeep (/sync), or the roadmap (/roadmap)."

## Output style (plain words, no dashes)

Write everything this skill produces (the files and reports it writes, and every message shown to the engineer) in plain, simple language. Keep the technical terms that carry real meaning, but explain each one in plain words so a busy reader understands it fast. Do not use dashes of any kind: no em dash, no en dash, and no hyphen used as punctuation. Use short sentences, commas, or parentheses instead. Clear beats clever.

## What this skill does

The context-bootstrapper. It gives every later skill (and every AI tool) an accurate picture of the project by writing the `AGENTS.md` files — and it handles all three starting points:

- **Greenfield** (no code yet): asks the engineer for the coding standards and conventions, and **seeds the root `AGENTS.md`** from the answers — including the project's **build approach** (name + one-line principle) read from the roadmap header if `/roadmap` set one — so the very first `/develop` already has ambient conventions to build to. (This is the cold-start fix: without it, the foundational stack/standards/build-approach decision has nowhere to land.) On greenfield this runs **after the project is scaffolded with its chosen stack** — the greenfield spine is `/roadmap` → `/architect` (decide the stack) → **scaffold the project** → `/audit`, so it seeds conventions + tooling from the *real* project; running it before the stack is chosen and scaffolded is premature.
- **Brownfield, undocumented** (code, no `AGENTS.md`): scans the whole project, then **writes the root `AGENTS.md` AND creates nested `<area>/AGENTS.md` files** — using judgment about what is global (→ root) versus area-specific (→ nested).
- **Brownfield, partially documented** (code + some `AGENTS.md` already): checks the existing root and nested docs **against the whole codebase** and **adds only what's missing** — new global facts, and nested docs for undocumented areas — never clobbering curated content.

Does not create ADRs (/architect owns those). Does not maintain files after changes (/sync owns that). Does not write the feature roadmap (/roadmap owns `docs/roadmap/`).

## Context-file convention (AGENTS.md is canonical)

These skills work across all AI tools, so the durable context lives in the **tool-agnostic `AGENTS.md`** (root and nested) — every agent (Codex, Cursor, Claude Code, …) reads it. `CLAUDE.md` is **only a one-line pointer** to its sibling `AGENTS.md`, so Claude Code (which reads `CLAUDE.md`) is forwarded to the shared content. Content is never duplicated across the two.

Rules this skill obeys:
- **Write knowledge into `AGENTS.md`.** Create it when missing. **Never overwrite or clobber an existing `AGENTS.md`** — it may be authored by the user or another tool; gap-fill conservatively (with permission) instead.
- **Maintain `CLAUDE.md` as a pointer only.** Its entire body imports the sibling AGENTS.md via Claude Code's `@` import, so Claude auto-loads the canonical content (other tools read AGENTS.md directly):
  ```
  # CLAUDE.md

  This project's context for all AI tools lives in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).
  Claude Code loads it via the import below:

  @AGENTS.md
  ```
- **Migrate legacy content.** If a content-ful `CLAUDE.md` exists but no `AGENTS.md`, ask permission, then move its content into a new `AGENTS.md` and replace `CLAUDE.md` with the pointer. Never silently discard curated content.
- The same root/nested rules apply to `AGENTS.md` as previously applied to `CLAUDE.md` (root is short and global; nested only for meaningful areas with real conventions).

## Scope

From the argument or task description:

| Input | Phase triggered |
|---|---|
| No argument, **ambiguous** (scaffolded but no git history) | Phase 0 — ask new-vs-existing, then route |
| No argument, **new project** (no/boilerplate code, no AGENTS.md) | Phase 1 — greenfield setup (ask standards → seed root) |
| No argument, **established codebase**, no root AGENTS.md | Phase 2 — whole-repo scan (create root **+ judged nested**) |
| Path or area name (e.g. `auth`, `src/payments`) | Phase 3 — area scan |
| No argument, codebase exists, root AGENTS.md **already exists** | Phase 4 — gap-fill (audit codebase vs existing docs, add what's missing) |

The choice is made from **several signals** (source count, git history, manifests), not a file count alone — see Pre-flight. A content-ful legacy `CLAUDE.md` with no `AGENTS.md` is migrated, then treated as Phase 4.

## Acts vs asks

- Phase 1: asks coding-standards questions via MCQ before creating root AGENTS.md.
- Phase 2: acts immediately, no questions — writes root and creates the nested docs it judges warranted.
- Phase 3: acts to explore; asks permission before modifying an existing root AGENTS.md, and before migrating a legacy CLAUDE.md.
- Phase 4: acts to explore the whole codebase; **asks permission before applying additions to the existing root AGENTS.md** (nested-doc creation for undocumented areas it reports first, then applies on confirmation).

## Artifact ownership

| File | Rule |
|---|---|
| Root `AGENTS.md` | The content. Create if missing (Phase 1, 2). Gap-fill with permission if it exists (Phase 3, 4). **Never overwrite.** |
| Root `CLAUDE.md` | Pointer only. Create the forward-to-`AGENTS.md` pointer if missing; migrate its content into `AGENTS.md` (with permission) if it's a legacy content-ful file. |
| `<area>/AGENTS.md` | The content for that area. Create if missing and the area warrants it (Phase 2, 3, 4 — by judgment). Propose additions if it exists; never overwrite. |
| `<area>/CLAUDE.md` | Pointer only, forwarding to `<area>/AGENTS.md`. |

When creating a nested `AGENTS.md`, add exactly one pointer line to root `AGENTS.md` under `## Context files`:
```
- [<area>/AGENTS.md](<area>/AGENTS.md) (<one-line description>)
```

Never create a nested AGENTS.md for every subfolder — only where distinct conventions exist.

---

## Portability (any OS, any agent)

Written for any Agent Skills client on macOS, Linux, or Windows:
- **Commands**: `git` is the only required CLI and behaves the same on every OS. Other shell snippets (file counts, `find`, `[ -f ]`) are POSIX **reference**, not literal scripts — use your agent's own cross-platform file tools (search/glob, read, write) to list and count source files and check existence instead.
- **Bundled files**: the pattern presets (`patterns/*.md`) and `agent-prompt.md` are referenced by paths relative to this skill's folder; the main agent reads them and injects the needed text **into the subagent prompt** — subagents can't resolve skill-relative paths.
- **No subagent / interactive-question support?** The spawn-a-subagent steps assume a subagent capability, and the multiple-choice steps assume an interactive picker (use whatever your agent provides — a subagent capability, per-step model selection, an options picker — and fall back only where it doesn't). On a tool without them: do the subagent's work inline yourself (use a cheaper model where the step calls for one), and ask any multiple-choice question as plain text with the same options.

## Execution

### Pre-flight (main model does this before anything else)

**Don't decide on a file count alone** — a scaffold inflates it, an unfamiliar language zeroes it out. Gather several signals:

1. **Context files.** Using your file tools, check for a root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`: AGENTS.md present → `ROOT_EXISTS`; a content-ful CLAUDE.md only → `ROOT_LEGACY`; neither → `ROOT_MISSING`.

2. **Source count.** Using your file tools, count the project's source files across the common ecosystems (extensions like `.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx/.py/.go/.rs/.java/.rb/.swift/.kt/.php/.cs/.dart/.ex/.exs/.scala/.c/.cpp/.h/.lua/.clj`), excluding vendored/generated dirs (`node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`) and config files (`*.config.*`).

3. **Established-project signals.** Run `git log --oneline` to gauge commit-history depth. Using your file tools, check for a real manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `composer.json`, `*.csproj`, `pubspec.yaml`, `mix.exs`, `Gemfile`).

4. **Monorepo signal.** Using your file tools, check for workspace markers (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, or a `"workspaces"` field in `package.json`) and for any `apps/*/package.json` or `packages/*/package.json` near the root.

**Pick the phase. Two questions, in order: (1) is there real code to scan? (source files OR a manifest) (2) if yes, is it built (git history) or just scaffolded (no history)?**

| Condition | Phase |
|---|---|
| Area path given as argument | Phase 3 (area scan) |
| `ROOT_EXISTS` (or `ROOT_LEGACY` after migration) | Phase 4 (gap-fill) |
| `ROOT_MISSING`, **no source files AND no manifest** | Phase 1 (greenfield) — nothing to scan, even if `docs/`/ADR/roadmap commits exist |
| `ROOT_MISSING`, has code (source ≥ 10 **or** a manifest), **≥ 2 commits** | Phase 2 (whole-repo) — real work happened, any language |
| `ROOT_MISSING`, has code (source ≥ 10 **or** a manifest), **≤ 1 commit** | **Phase 0 (ask)** — looks scaffolded; can't tell new from existing |

Why this order (both learned from dry-running it):
- **Doc commits inflate history.** On greenfield, `/roadmap` and `/architect` commit a roadmap and an ADR *before* any code — so "≥2 commits → established" would misroute a code-less project to Phase 2 and skip the standards questions. Gating greenfield on **no source AND no manifest** ignores doc commits.
- **File count alone misreads a scaffold.** A fresh framework scaffold has 10+ files but **one** commit — git history is what separates it from a built codebase, and history works for languages the source scan doesn't recognize. A shallow clone / squash-merge repo showing ≤1 commit falls to Phase 0, where one question resolves it safely.

**Monorepo (`MONOREPO=yes`) — root + a light stub per workspace, deepen on demand.** Each workspace (`apps/*`, `packages/*`) is a first-class area, and its **primary doc lives at the workspace root** (`packages/api/AGENTS.md`), never buried deeper.

- **A whole-repo run (no path arg)** does *not* deep-scan every workspace — on a big monorepo that's too expensive and premature. Instead: write the **repo-root `AGENTS.md`** (monorepo-wide: tooling, shared conventions) **plus a *light stub* `AGENTS.md` for every workspace** — its `## Stack` + `## Commands` read straight from that workspace's manifest (scoped, e.g. `pnpm -F <name> …`), no code scan — and a root `## Context files` pointer to each. This is cheap and gives `/architect`/`/develop` every workspace's stack immediately.
- **Deepen on demand.** The full conventions/gotchas/key-files scan for a workspace happens when the engineer runs **`/audit packages/api`** (Phase 3, area scan) — or the first time they build there — filling out that one workspace's doc. Don't do all of them upfront.
- **Deeper docs are sub-nested and linked.** If a spot *inside* a workspace warrants its own doc (`packages/ui/src/mdx/`), create it **in addition to** the workspace-root doc (`packages/ui/AGENTS.md`) and add a pointer to it from the workspace-root doc — the same root→nested pattern, one level down.
- **Pre-existing deep `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`.** If a doc already exists *buried* in a workspace (e.g. `packages/ui/src/mdx/CLAUDE.md`) but the workspace **root has none**, don't just leave it there. **Ask**: "`packages/ui` has a context file at `src/mdx/` but none at its root. Move it up to `packages/ui/AGENTS.md`, or keep it as a nested doc under a new `packages/ui/AGENTS.md`?" On *move* → relocate it to the workspace root. On *keep nested* → create the workspace-root `AGENTS.md` **and** keep the deep one, linking the deep one from the root doc. Migrate legacy `CLAUDE.md` content per the convention above.

Note `MONOREPO=yes` + the workspace list in the subagent prompt.

---

**Legacy migration (any phase):** if detection returned `ROOT_LEGACY` (content-ful root `CLAUDE.md`, no `AGENTS.md`), before proceeding ask permission to migrate: "I found a `CLAUDE.md` with project context but no `AGENTS.md`. I'll move its content into a new `AGENTS.md` (so all tools read it) and replace `CLAUDE.md` with a pointer. Proceed?" On yes: the subagent copies the content verbatim into `AGENTS.md`, then replaces `CLAUDE.md` with the pointer. **After migration, `AGENTS.md` now exists → continue as Phase 4 (gap-fill)** to fill anything the legacy file lacked. On no: leave both untouched and continue without migrating. The same applies to any nested `<area>/CLAUDE.md`.

### Phase 0 — Classify (only when pre-flight is ambiguous)

Don't guess. Ask once — present these as your agent's interactive option picker (`AskUserQuestion` on Claude Code) — or as plain-text options with the same choices if it has none:
- **question**: "I can't tell if this is a new project or an existing codebase (<state why: e.g. 'a manifest exists but I see no source in a language I recognise', or 'files look like untouched scaffolding'>). Which is it?"
- **header**: "Project state"
- **options**:
  1. `New project`, "I'll ask for your coding standards and seed the context." → **Phase 1** (read the manifest/scaffold for the stack; still ask standards).
  2. `Existing codebase`, "I'll scan what's here and document it." → **Phase 2**.

Then route to the chosen phase.

### Phase 1 — Greenfield setup

**Trigger**: pre-flight classified **clearly greenfield**, or Phase 0 → `New project`.

On greenfield, `/audit` is meant to run **after the project has been scaffolded with its chosen stack** (`/roadmap` → `/architect` decides the stack → scaffold → `/audit`) — so it seeds `AGENTS.md` conventions + tooling from the real project. Running before the stack is chosen and scaffolded is premature; the standards questions and root-seed behavior below are unchanged either way.

**Step 1 — Ask coding patterns AND tooling (main model asks, in batched rounds, tailored to the scaffolded stack).**

This is the one place the project's conventions and tooling get set, so **be thorough, not minimal** — a greenfield audit that asks two questions leaves most of the foundation unset. **First read the real scaffolded project** (its manifest, any config already present, and which tools the scaffold installed), then tailor every question to it: **skip a question the stack already settles**, list an **already-installed tool first as the suggested pick**, and phrase options for the actual language and framework. Ask as decision panels (one suggested pick each; the picker adds Other automatically), batched **up to 4 per round**, as many rounds as it takes. The answers are captured into `AGENTS.md`. **`/audit` records the choices, it does not install anything** — installing the chosen tooling (packages, config files, pre-commit hooks, CI) is the **`/develop tooling`** sub-task that follows. So ask the tooling questions here (this is where the choice is made and recorded), even though the actual install happens later in `/develop`.

**Architecture & code conventions:**
- **Architecture style** (single-select) — read `patterns/clean-architecture.md`, `patterns/functional.md`, `patterns/domain-driven.md`, `patterns/solid-oop.md` for labels/descriptions and present all four.
- **Type strictness** (typed languages only; skip if untyped) — `strict` (no `any`, exhaustive types) · `gradual` (strict for new code) · `loose`.
- **Module & folder structure** — `folder-by-feature` (colocate by feature) · `by-layer` (controllers/services/repos) · match what the scaffold already set.
- **Additional code standards** (multi-select) — documented public APIs · a consistent error-handling pattern · validate env vars at startup · named exports only (no default exports) · consistent naming conventions · accessibility baseline on UI (WCAG AA) · conventional commit messages.

**Tooling (asked here, installed by `/develop tooling`):**
- **Linting & formatting** (single-select, adaptive) — the standard linter + formatter for this stack (suggested; list an already-installed one first) · a specific alternative · minimal for now.
- **Pre-commit enforcement** (single-select) — lint + format + typecheck on every commit (suggested) · format only · none.
- **Testing gate** (single-select; captured as the convention, the runner is set up by `/test`) — unit + integration with a framework (suggested) · typecheck + manual `/verify` only · tests-first (TDD).
- **Continuous integration** (single-select) — a basic CI check on push (lint, typecheck, test) (suggested) · not yet · already configured.

Adapt the list to the project: drop what doesn't apply (no CI question for a throwaway prototype, no type-strictness for an untyped language), and add any stack-specific convention worth pinning. The goal is a foundation a small team can build on without re-litigating basics mid-build.

**Step 2 — Inject selected pattern content**:
- If a named pattern was selected: the main model already read all four files in Step 1 — do not re-read. Use the full content of the matching file as `SELECTED_PATTERNS`.
- If "Other" was selected (free-text input): no pattern files were read in Step 1. Use the engineer's exact typed text as `SELECTED_PATTERNS` — pass it directly, no file to read.

**Step 3 — Spawn a subagent** with:
- `model`: a strong model (e.g. `sonnet`/`opus` on Claude Code)
- `description: "Audit: greenfield setup — create root AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md pointer"`
- Tools: `Read`, `Bash`, `Write`
- `prompt`: filled `agent-prompt.md` template with `PHASE=greenfield`, `SELECTED_PATTERNS=<file contents>`, `ADDITIONAL_STANDARDS=<all the other Step 1 selections: the code standards, type strictness, folder structure, AND the tooling choices (lint/format, pre-commit, testing gate, CI)>`, and **`MONOREPO_OR_NO`** (`yes — apps: web, api, …` if detected). The subagent records the code conventions in `AGENTS.md` `## Rules`; capture the **tooling choices** clearly (a short `## Tooling` note or explicit Rules lines) so the `/develop tooling` sub-task installs exactly what was chosen here. The subagent writes root `AGENTS.md` + its `CLAUDE.md` pointer — seeding `## Build approach` from the roadmap header if one is set (else `<TBD — set by /roadmap>`) — **and, if `MONOREPO=yes`, a nested `AGENTS.md` (+ pointer) per workspace** seeded from each scaffold's manifest, with the root pointers baked in. **Before spawning, run the Tool-skills sweep (below)** and inject its `INSTALLED_SKILLS` / `DECLINED_TOOLS` so the subagent writes the `Agent skills:` line into `AGENTS.md`.

---

### Tool-skills & MCP sweep (offer matching Agent Skills and MCP servers — greenfield after scaffold, and whole-repo)

Run this on the **main thread** once the real stack is known (greenfield: from the scaffolded manifests read in Step 1; brownfield: from the repo scan below). It is the setup-time sweep that catches the whole stack at once — `/architect` offers at the moment a tool is *chosen*; this offers for whatever is *already installed*.
- For each significant tool in the real stack (framework, database, ORM, auth, payments, email, and so on) **not already covered** by an installed skill / connected MCP (`npx skills list`, your connector list) or recorded as **declined** in `AGENTS.md`:
  - **Detect** a matching **Agent Skill** (`npx skills find <tool>`, the `skills` CLI's registry search, `--owner <org>` if known, else a web search for "<tool> agent skill") **and** a matching **MCP server** (a web search for "<tool> MCP server", or your agent's connector list). **Never hardcode** a list of which tools have skills or servers.
- **Batch-offer** the ones found as a **multi-select** panel, skills and MCP servers together: "Set up the tools that have one? · Skill: `<tool A>` (`<owner/repo>`) · MCP: `<tool B>` server · … · none of these". Capability-first picker; plain text where there is none. **Never auto-install or auto-connect.**
- **Install** each selected skill: `npx skills add <owner>/<repo> -y`. **Connecting an MCP is a user config step** (their MCP/connector settings, e.g. `claude mcp add …`) — you can't do it for them, so point them there; once connected the tools are used automatically.
- **Record into `AGENTS.md`** (the subagent writes it, from `INSTALLED_SKILLS` / `MCP_SERVERS` / `DECLINED_TOOLS` you pass): an **`Agent skills:`** line (`installed: …`, `declined: …`) and an **`MCP servers:`** line (`connected: …`, `declined: …`) — the declines so a later run does not re-offer. Project-wide tech at root; area-specific ones in the nested area doc.
- **No search/install/connect capability?** Skip the offer and note in the report which tools might have a skill or MCP worth a manual look (the passive fallback).

---

### Phase 2 — Whole-repo scan (root + judged nested)

**Trigger**: pre-flight classified **clearly established**, or Phase 0 → `Existing codebase`. **Run the Tool-skills sweep above** once the scan has identified the stack, before/with writing `AGENTS.md`.

The subagent doesn't just write root — it **identifies the major areas with distinct conventions** (e.g. `src/auth`, `src/payments`, `src/api`) and creates a nested `AGENTS.md` for each that warrants one, deciding by judgment what is global (→ root) vs area-specific (→ nested). Root stays short; area detail lives nested.

**Spawn a subagent** with:
- `model`: a strong model
- `description: "Audit: whole-repo scan — root + nested AGENTS.md"`
- Tools: `Read`, `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit` (`Edit` to add nested pointers into the root it just wrote)
- `prompt`: filled `agent-prompt.md` with `PHASE=whole-repo`, AGENTS.md noted as MISSING. The subagent writes root `AGENTS.md`, creates each warranted nested `<area>/AGENTS.md` (+ its `CLAUDE.md` pointer), and adds one pointer line per nested doc into root's `## Context files`.

---

### Phase 3 — Area scan

**Trigger**: a path or area name was given (e.g. `/audit src/auth`).

**Pre-flight additionally**:
1. Using your file tools, check whether the area path exists.
   If it does not exist: stop immediately. Tell the engineer: "Path `<area>` not found. Check the path and try again." Do not spawn a subagent.
2. Read root `AGENTS.md` (the canonical file).
   - If root AGENTS.md is **missing** (and no legacy CLAUDE.md to migrate): run Phase 2 fully first (spawn whole-repo subagent, wait for it to write root AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md pointer), then continue with Phase 3.
   - If only a legacy root `CLAUDE.md` exists: run the legacy migration above first.
   - If root AGENTS.md **exists**: proceed directly.
3. Check if `<area>/AGENTS.md` exists — note present or missing.

**Spawn a subagent** with:
- `model`: a strong model
- `description: "Audit: area scan — <area>"`
- Tools: `Read`, `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`
- `prompt`: filled `agent-prompt.md` with `PHASE=area`, `AREA=<path>`, root and nested `AGENTS.md` contents injected. The subagent writes the area's content to `<area>/AGENTS.md` and creates `<area>/CLAUDE.md` as a pointer.

Note: the subagent adds the nested `AGENTS.md` pointer line to root `AGENTS.md` using the **Edit** tool — it does not re-create root AGENTS.md.

**After the subagent runs**, parse the report for the `Root gaps flagged` section:
- If `ROOT_GAPS: none` → relay the full report, done.
- If gaps exist → ask (as above):
  - Question: "I found things in `<area>` not reflected in root AGENTS.md. What should I do?"
  - Option 1: `Add them now`, description: "I'll apply the additions immediately"
  - Option 2: `Show me the diff`, description: "Print exactly what would change; I'll apply it manually"
  - Option 3: `Skip for now`, description: "Leave root AGENTS.md as-is"

  - If `Add them now`: parse the subagent report — locate the `ROOT_GAPS:` block and extract each line starting with `- `. Each line contains the exact markdown to insert and the target section (`— target section: ## <section>`). Apply one **Edit** tool call per gap into root `AGENTS.md`. Do not paraphrase.
  - If `Show me the diff`: print each addition as a fenced markdown block with the target section labelled. Do not write.
  - If `Skip for now`: do nothing.

Relay the full report after the choice is applied.

---

### Phase 4 — Gap-fill (root AGENTS.md already exists)

**Trigger**: no area argument, codebase exists, AND root AGENTS.md **already exists** (including right after a legacy `CLAUDE.md` migration). The project is partially documented — audit the whole codebase against what's written and fill the holes, conservatively.

**Pre-flight additionally**:
1. Read root `AGENTS.md` (inject its contents).
2. Using your file tools, list all nested `AGENTS.md` paths (excluding `node_modules` and `.git`) — inject the list.

**Spawn a subagent** with:
- `model`: a strong model
- `description: "Audit: gap-fill — codebase vs existing docs"`
- Tools: `Read`, `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`
- `prompt`: filled `agent-prompt.md` with `PHASE=gap-fill`, root AGENTS.md contents + nested paths injected. The subagent scans the codebase and finds three kinds of gap: (a) **global facts missing from root** (a command, stack element, or project-wide rule) → returns as `ROOT_GAPS` proposals; (b) **areas with distinct conventions but no nested doc** → creates the nested doc (+ pointer); (c) **existing nested docs missing something** → returns as `PROPOSED_ADDITIONS`. It never overwrites curated content.

**After the subagent runs**, handle proposals before applying:
- Nested docs it created for clearly-undocumented areas → already written; list them in the relay.
- `ROOT_GAPS` and `PROPOSED_ADDITIONS` to existing files → ask (as above) (`Add them now` / `Show me the diff` / `Skip for now`), exactly as in Phase 3, then apply with `Edit` (verbatim, no paraphrase) on `Add them now`.
- `CONTRADICTIONS` (docs the code disproves) → **surface to the engineer, do not auto-fix** — these touch possibly-curated lines. Relay each as "`<doc>` says *X*, but the code/ADR shows *Y*" and let them decide (correct it, or update the code). Never silently overwrite.

---

### After all phases

**If the subagent errored or wrote no `AGENTS.md`** when it should have (the file is missing/empty), report the failure and offer to re-run — don't relay success it didn't produce. Otherwise relay the subagent's report:
- What was discovered (2–4 bullets)
- What was written (file paths)
- What was proposed or skipped (if existing files were found)
