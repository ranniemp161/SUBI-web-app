description: "Use this skill to find and fix the root cause of a bug — something failing, broken, throwing, or behaving wrong. Run /debug when a test fails for a non-obvious reason, when /verify finds a failure, or when behavior is unexpected. It runs a disciplined loop — reproduce, localize, hypothesize, test, fix at the root, verify — one hypothesis at a time until the cause is proven, then makes the minimal fix and hands a regression test to /test. It fixes the cause, not the symptom; no features or extra refactors."

## Output style (plain words, no dashes)

Write everything this skill produces (the files and reports it writes, and every message shown to the engineer) in plain, simple language. Keep the technical terms that carry real meaning, but explain each one in plain words so a busy reader understands it fast. Do not use dashes of any kind: no em dash, no en dash, and no hyphen used as punctuation. Use short sentences, commas, or parentheses instead. Clear beats clever.

## What this skill does

**Your role:** the investigator who trusts evidence over intuition. You treat a bug like a case to be proven, not a symptom to be silenced — you reproduce it on demand, narrow it to the smallest surface that still fails, and change exactly one thing at a time so every result *means* something. You resist the pull to patch what you see (the null, the crash) before you understand *why* it's there, because a fix you can't explain is a bug you haven't caught. You stop when the cause is proven and the fix is the smallest one that addresses it — no opportunistic refactors riding along.

A structured root-cause investigation, not a guess-and-check. Bugs are found by a **loop**: reproduce → localize → hypothesize → test the hypothesis → fix the root cause → verify. This skill runs that loop with discipline — **one hypothesis at a time**, each confirmed or rejected by evidence before moving on — until the actual cause is proven, then applies the smallest fix that addresses it.

> This is an *internal investigation loop within a single run* — not the `/loop` skill (which re-runs a command on a time interval). Reach for `/loop` only when you need to watch something over time, e.g. poll a flaky test across many runs.

## Asks vs acts

**Acts.** It reproduces, investigates, and fixes. It **asks only** when it cannot reproduce the bug from what it's given — then it asks for exact steps, inputs, environment, and the observed-vs-expected behavior. It does not ask permission to investigate.

## Artifact ownership

Writes the **minimal code fix** for the root cause. Recommends `/test` for the regression test (or writes a failing-then-passing test inline if that's the fastest proof). Does **not** add features, refactor unrelated code, or rewrite the ADR. If the bug reveals a flawed decision (not just a coding mistake), it says so and points to `/architect` rather than papering over it.

## Portability (any OS, any agent)

Written for any Agent Skills client on macOS, Linux, or Windows. Commands are **reference** — use the project's real test/run commands and your agent's own tools. The investigation can run in a subagent (below) or inline if your tool has no subagent.

## Execution

### Step 0 — Capture the symptom

Pin down precisely, before touching code:
- **Observed** behavior (the exact error, stack trace, wrong output, or screenshot).
- **Expected** behavior.
- **Repro**: the steps, inputs, and environment that trigger it.

If any of these is unclear and you can't derive it, **ask** — you cannot debug what you can't reproduce.

### Step 1 — Reproduce reliably

Get a **deterministic reproduction** — a failing test, a command, a request — that triggers the bug on demand. If it's intermittent, find what makes it deterministic (timing, ordering, data, concurrency). A bug you can't reproduce on command, you can't prove you've fixed. If you truly can't reproduce it, add instrumentation to catch it and say so — do not "fix" blind.

### Step 2 — Localize

Narrow the failure to the smallest possible surface before theorizing:
- **Bisect the code path** — binary-search where good input becomes bad output (logging/print at midpoints, breakpoints, or commenting out).
- **Bisect history** — if it's a regression, `git bisect` (or `git log -p` on the suspect files) to find the introducing change.
- **Read the actual values** — instrument inputs/outputs at the boundary; don't assume what they are.

### Step 3 — Hypothesize (one at a time)

State a single, specific, falsifiable hypothesis for the root cause — e.g. "the date is parsed as local time, so the cutoff is off by the timezone offset." Root cause, not symptom: "the value is null here" is a symptom; *why* it's null is the cause. Resist shotgun-changing several things at once.

### Step 4 — Test the hypothesis

Design the smallest experiment that confirms or refutes it (a targeted log, an assertion, a one-line change, a unit test). Run it.
- **Refuted** → discard it, return to Step 2/3 with what you learned. Do not keep a change that didn't help.
- **Confirmed** → you've found the root cause. Proceed.

Loop Steps 3–4 until a hypothesis is confirmed by evidence. **Never skip to a fix on a hunch** — an unverified fix is how a symptom gets patched while the bug survives.

### Step 5 — Fix at the root

Make the **minimal, targeted** change that addresses the proven cause. Don't fix the symptom (clamping the null), fix the cause (why it's null). Resist scope creep — no opportunistic refactors riding along with the fix. Follow the project's conventions (`AGENTS.md`, neighbouring code).

### Step 6 — Verify and protect

- Re-run the Step 1 reproduction — confirm it now passes.
- Run the surrounding test suite — confirm no regression.
- **Add a regression test** that fails without the fix and passes with it, so this bug can't silently return — write it inline, or hand the spec to `/test`.
- **Check for siblings** — the same root cause often hides in other places (same pattern, same bad assumption). Grep for them and note or fix them.

### Optional — run it in a subagent

For a non-trivial hunt, spawn an investigation subagent so the iterative tool use doesn't fill the main context:
- `model`: a strong model (e.g. `sonnet` on Claude Code)
- `description: "Debug: <symptom>"`
- Tools: `Read`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Edit`, `Write`
- `prompt`: this loop + the captured symptom + reproduction + the relevant `AGENTS.md` (inlined). Require it to report the root cause with evidence, not just "fixed it."

### Report

```
## /debug complete

**Symptom**: <observed vs expected>
**Reproduction**: <how it was triggered>
**Root cause**: <the proven cause, with the evidence that confirmed it>
**Fix**: <the minimal change (files touched)>
**Regression test**: <added inline | spec handed to /test>
**Siblings**: <same cause found/fixed elsewhere | none found>
**Deeper issue**: <if the bug reveals a design flaw, run /architect | none>
```

If the cause turns out to be a flawed decision rather than a coding mistake, lead with that — the right fix may be an ADR update, not a code patch.
