# NNNN. Title (concise, noun-phrase form, e.g. "Adopt a relational database for primary storage")

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: Proposed

## Summary

<!-- HUMAN QUICK READ (plain words, no dashes). Everyone reads this first, technical or not. -->
<Plain language overview in 2 to 4 short sentences. Say what this decision is, why it was made,
and what it means for building. A busy reader (technical or not) should get the gist in about 20
seconds. Explain any technical term in plain words (a short gloss in parentheses). Use no dashes
of any kind.>

## Context

<!-- DECISION RECORD (the WHY, human context; /develop skips this) -->
<What is the problem or decision to be made? What forces are at play (technical constraints,
team capabilities, cost, performance requirements, compliance)? What is the consequence of not
deciding? 2 to 4 paragraphs. Do not mention options here, only the problem space.>

## Requirements

<!-- BUILD SPEC (the WHAT, /develop builds to this; /verify checks against it) -->
<!-- The contract. Seed the user stories + acceptance criteria from the roadmap feature's intent
     and its acceptance-criteria seeds when a roadmap row exists, then refine with the engineer.
     Acceptance criteria are the contract /develop builds to and /verify checks. -->

**User stories**:
- As a <role>, I want <capability> so that <outcome>.

**Acceptance criteria** (the contract, each criterion is IDed and independently checkable):
- **AC-1**: <observable, testable outcome that must hold for the feature to be correct>
- **AC-2**: <the key edge case or failure that must be handled, e.g. "retry after timeout returns the same result (idempotent)">
- **AC-N**: <…>

<!-- Every task in ## Build plan references the AC(s) it satisfies, and every scenario in
     Critical test scenarios maps to an AC. No AC without a build task; no build task without an AC. -->

## Options considered

<!-- DECISION RECORD (the WHY, human context; /develop skips this) -->
### Option 1: <Name>

<One paragraph describing this option.>

**Pros**:
- <benefit>

**Cons**:
- <drawback or tradeoff>

### Option 2: <Name>

<One paragraph describing this option.>

**Pros**:
- <benefit>

**Cons**:
- <drawback or tradeoff>

<!-- Add Option 3 / Option 4 if relevant. Maximum 4 options. Omit section entirely only
     when documenting a decision already made with no alternatives considered. -->

## Decision

<!-- BUILD SPEC (the WHAT, /develop reads this) -->
**Chosen option**: Option N: <Name>

<One sentence stating the decision clearly.>

**Implementation skills**: `<skill-name>` (`.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`) · `<skill-name>` (`.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`)
<!-- List every installed community skill that informed this design. The engineer reads this field during implementation to know which skill conventions to apply. Omit line entirely if no community skills were used. -->

## Rationale

<!-- DECISION RECORD (the WHY, human context; /develop skips this) -->
<Why this option over the others? Reference the specific constraints and forces from Context.
Do not repeat the pros/cons list, explain the reasoning. 1 to 3 paragraphs.>

<!-- Feature design mode only. Include immediately after Rationale. -->
<!-- BUILD SPEC (the WHAT, /develop reads this) -->
## Feature design

**Data model sketch**:
<Entities, key fields, nullable/required, FK relationships, unique constraints>

**State transitions** (if applicable):
<e.g. order: draft → submitted → paid → fulfilled. Omit if no state machine>

**API surface**:
| Endpoint | Method | Key inputs | Key outputs | Auth | Key errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| /resource | POST | field:type (req) | id, status | bearer | 409, 422 |

**Key invariants**:
<Rules that must always hold, enforced at application or DB layer>

**Security model**:
<Who can read/write what. Roles, ownership, public/private. Name compliance scope if applicable.>

**Configuration required**:
- `ENV_VAR_NAME`: purpose (omit section if no new env vars or credentials are needed)

<!-- Acceptance criteria are NOT restated here; they live once, IDed, in ## Requirements (the contract).
     Reference their IDs (AC-N) from the test scenarios below and from ## Build plan tasks. -->

**Critical test scenarios** (each maps to an acceptance criterion in ## Requirements):
- Happy path: <main flow end to end>, verifies **AC-N**
- Failure case: <most important failure, such as concurrency, timeout, invalid state>, verifies **AC-N**
- Auth/permission: <who is denied and what they receive>, verifies **AC-N**

<!-- Architecture mode only. Include immediately after Rationale. -->
<!-- BUILD SPEC (the WHAT, /develop reads this) -->
## Proposed stack

| Layer | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Language | | |
| Framework | | |
| Primary DB | | |
| Auth | | |
| Hosting | | |
| Observability | | |

<!-- BUILD SPEC (the WHAT, /develop builds these in order; /verify checks the AC each satisfies) -->
## Build plan

<!-- Ordered build tasks DERIVED from the surface above (data model, API, stack) and the acceptance
     criteria in ## Requirements. Each task names the AC(s) it satisfies, so every AC traces to at least
     one task and every task traces to an AC. The ORDER and slicing reflect the project's build approach
     (Tracer Bullet, Skateboard, Facade, Journey, or a variant, read in pre-flight), reasoned about for
     this feature rather than by a fixed recipe. The data-model migration is normally task 1 (from the
     confirmed data model) and stays early; a UI-first Facade/prototype approach may lead with the shell.
     When a roadmap feature row links this ADR, these tasks are also written into that row's sub-tasks;
     with no roadmap row, they live here as the source of truth (see /architect's derive-tasks step). -->

1. <Build task, e.g. "Create the migration for the confirmed data model">, satisfies **AC-1**
2. <Build task>, satisfies **AC-2**, **AC-3**
N. <Build task>, satisfies **AC-N**

## Consequences

<!-- BUILD SPEC (the WHAT, /develop reads this: the constraints the build must honor) -->
**Positive**:
- <what improves>

**Negative / tradeoffs**:
- <what gets worse or costs more>

**Neutral**:
- <notable side-effects, migrations needed, new patterns to learn, etc.>

## Follow-up

- [ ] <Action item or open question>
<!-- Omit section if there are no follow-up actions. -->

## References

<!-- INCLUDED ONLY WHEN THE ENGINEER OPTED IN (REFERENCES_LEVEL is `sources` or `sources+links`).
     When REFERENCES_LEVEL is `none`, omit this whole section AND add no (basis: ...) citations
     anywhere in the ADR. The Rationale (the reasoning itself) still stays; only the citations and
     links are gated, so a `none` document reads clean.
     What this decision is grounded in. Group as below; omit empty groups. NEVER fabricate a URL,
     name the source/practice instead. The *Links* group appears only at the `sources+links` level,
     and every link in it must have been web verified by the subagent (at `sources` there is no
     Links group, and no web fetch happens). -->

**Project sources** (verifiable, in this repo):
- <e.g. `AGENTS.md`, the auth convention · ADR 0003 · an installed community skill · already on the project's BaaS>

**Practices & standards**:
- <named practice/principle the decision rests on, e.g. idempotency keys for money ops · strangler pattern · OWASP session guidance>

**Links** (web verified only, `sources+links` level only):
- <Title: https://real-fetched-url> · <or "none verified">

<!-- Enhancement mode only, when migration is non-trivial. -->
## Migration plan

**Strategy**: <strangler | big bang | feature-flagged | no migration needed>
**Phases**:
1. <Phase 1>
2. <Phase 2>
**Rollback**: <how to revert if a phase fails>
**Risks**: <what could go wrong>

<!-- Cross-cutting mode only. Include immediately after Rationale. -->
## Standard definition

**Canonical pattern**:
```<language>
// The one right way, concrete example
```

**Replaces**:
- <Pattern that is now wrong>

**Enforcement**:
<Lint rule / compile-time type / other, and where it is configured>

**Rollout**:
<New code immediately | single migration PR | gradual migration schedule>

**Exceptions**:
<When the standard does not apply, or "None">

## Filename conventions

- Format: `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`
- NNNN: zero-padded 4-digit number, auto-incremented
- Title: lowercase, hyphens, no articles at the start ("use-object-storage" not "the-use-of-object-storage")
- Examples: `0001-adopt-relational-db-for-primary-storage.md`, `0002-adopt-feature-flags-for-rollout.md`

## Status values

The ADR's status mirrors its feature's build lifecycle (roadmap: planned→`Proposed`, in-progress→`In Progress`, done→`Accepted`):

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Proposed` | ADR written, decision agreed, feature NOT yet built. Set by /architect at creation. |
| `In Progress` | The feature governed by this ADR is being built. Set by /develop when the feature goes in-progress. |
| `Accepted` | The feature is built and verified (roadmap `done`) — the "done and dusted" state. An ADR is NOT `Accepted` until its feature ships. Set by /develop on completion or reconciled by /sync. |
| `Superseded by [NNNN](NNNN-title.md)` | Replaced by a newer ADR |

**Which status behavior applies depends on whether a buildable roadmap feature links this ADR:**
- **Feature-linked ADR** (a `docs/roadmap/` row's `ADR` cell points to it) → **feature-mirrored**: `Proposed` → `In Progress` → `Accepted`, tracking the feature's build lifecycle (table above). Confirmation ratifies content but does not set `Accepted`; /develop advances it.
- **Standalone decision ADR** (a foundational/stack or cross-cutting standard with **no linked buildable feature**) → **decision-status**: `Proposed` when written, then **`Accepted` once the engineer ratifies it** (on confirmation). There's no build phase to gate on, so it is not feature-mirrored.
- **ADR documenting already-shipped work** (the "already built" path, or a feature already `existing`) → **born `Accepted`** — it describes reality that already exists.

**Umbrella child ADRs carry no lifecycle status.** In an umbrella directory (`NNNN-<x>/`), only the `index.md` has a `**Status**:` line — it mirrors the feature. The **child ADRs are spec content**, so **omit the `**Status**:` line on children** (they're governed by the umbrella). `/develop` and `/sync` advance the umbrella `index.md`'s status only, never a child's.

**A directory ADR is a self-mapping manifest.** In a directory ADR (`NNNN-<x>/`), the top file (`index.md`, or the ADR file for a single decision with research) opens with a **`## Structure`** section listing and linking **every** child ADR and **every** research file — one line each: what it is + which decision it supports. Each **child ADR** links its own evidence in a **`## References`** section. **Research files are named by their owner**: `research/NNNN-<topic>.md` for the child numbered `NNNN`, or `research/_shared-<topic>.md` for umbrella-wide evidence — so every file's ownership is obvious, and a developer building a child follows *that child's* `## References` to exactly the research it needs. **Children are flat files by default** — give a child its own subfolder only when it accumulates multiple research/asset files. Each child ADR is **self-sufficient to build from**; `research/` is **optional depth** (the evidence trail), not required reading for `/develop`. Any **cross-child contract** (how children connect) belongs in the umbrella `index.md`.

## Audience split — build spec vs decision record

An ADR serves two audiences, and its sections divide cleanly between them:

- **Build spec** (what `/develop` reads to build): **`## Requirements`** (the acceptance-criteria contract), **`## Decision`**, the design/spec section (**`## Feature design`** for a FEATURE ADR, **`## Proposed stack`** for an ARCHITECTURE ADR, or the equivalent spec table — e.g. `## Standard definition`), **`## Build plan`** (the ordered tasks derived from the surface + acceptance criteria), and **`## Consequences`** (the constraints the build must honor). This is the WHAT — the implementable spec. The **acceptance criteria in `## Requirements` are the contract `/develop` builds to and `/verify` checks.**
- **Decision record** (human / future decision-maker context — the WHY): **`## Summary`** (the plain-words human quick read), **`## Context`**, **`## Options considered`**, and **`## Rationale`**. This is decision history, not build input; `/develop` can skip it unless a specific constraint sends it back to the reasoning.

The full reasoning always stays in the ADR — this split only labels which sections each audience needs; it does not remove or reorder anything.

## Writing rules

- Summary is the human quick read: plain words, 2 to 4 short sentences, no dashes; it comes first so everyone gets the gist fast
- Context describes the problem, not the solution
- Each option must be described fairly — do not write straw-man alternatives
- Rationale must reference specific forces from Context, not just repeat pros/cons
- Consequences must include negatives — an ADR with only positives is not credible
- Follow-up items are optional but recommended for full-tier decisions
- **One decision per ADR — keep it focused and scannable.** Length follows the decision, not a line count: don't pad, and never cut a required design field (data model, state machine, full API table, security model, acceptance criteria) to make the record shorter. If it needs *multiple independent decisions*, or the design won't fit cleanly in one scannable ADR, split it into an **umbrella ADR + child ADRs** (the directory shape) rather than letting one file sprawl.
