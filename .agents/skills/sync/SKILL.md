description: "Use this skill after a change is complete to keep durable knowledge current. Run /sync as the last step on medium/full work, around merge. It updates the AGENTS.md context files (root + nested) to reflect what changed, reconciles the feature roadmap's status from repo evidence, and flags any ADR the change made stale. Conservative: surgical, additive edits that never overwrite curated content; it doesn't restructure root (/audit) or edit ADRs (/architect)."

## Output style (plain words, no dashes)

Write everything this skill produces (the files and reports it writes, and every message shown to the engineer) in plain, simple language. Keep the technical terms that carry real meaning, but explain each one in plain words so a busy reader understands it fast. Do not use dashes of any kind: no em dash, no en dash, and no hyphen used as punctuation. Use short sentences, commas, or parentheses instead. Clear beats clever.

## What this skill does

Closes the loop on a change by syncing the durable knowledge to reality:

1. **Maintains existing AGENTS.md** — root and nested — so commands, conventions, and constraints stay accurate after the change. This includes reconciling root's `## Build approach` line (a project-wide convention) to the roadmap header when the approach changes — a surgical single-line edit, like the stack.
2. **Creates a nested AGENTS.md for a brand-new area** the change introduced wholesale (plus the root pointer line).
3. **Reconciles each linked ADR's Status line** to its feature's roadmap status — the `**Status**:` line only, never ADR content.
4. **Flags stale ADRs** the change contradicted/outgrew or a later ADR supersedes, and recommends /architect. It does not edit ADR content.

These four behaviors, plus roadmap reconciliation, follow the detailed rules in **`agent-prompt.md`** (the single source of truth — including the canonical-file/CLAUDE.md-pointer model, net-new-area creation test, idempotency, the ADR Status-line mapping and standalone-vs-feature-linked distinction, stale-ADR flagging, and roadmap sub-task reconciliation). SKILL.md below covers only orchestration.

Runs on a fast, low-cost model (e.g. `haiku` on Claude Code; `inherit`/a light model on other agents) in a subagent. Acts — no upfront questions.

**Canonical file:** durable context lives in the tool-agnostic **`AGENTS.md`**; **`CLAUDE.md` is only a pointer** to it. /sync edits/creates `AGENTS.md` (and its `CLAUDE.md` pointer) and treats both only as targets, never as a change source — see `agent-prompt.md` for the exact rules.

## Boundaries (these keep the skill from sprawling)

| Action | /sync | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Edit existing root/nested AGENTS.md | ✅ maintains | /sync |
| Reconcile root AGENTS.md's `## Build approach` line to the roadmap header's approach (surgical single-line edit, like the stack) | ✅ maintains; flags a curated divergence | /sync |
| Create nested `<area>/AGENTS.md` for an area **net-new in this change** | ✅ creates (diff = full area context) + adds root pointer | /sync |
| Create nested doc for a **pre-existing** undocumented area (only sliced by the diff) | ❌ flags "run /audit" | /audit |
| Create or restructure the **root** AGENTS.md | ❌ flags "run /audit" | /audit |
| Reconcile an ADR's `**Status**:` line to its feature's roadmap status (`planned`→`Proposed`, `in-progress`→`In Progress`, `done`→`Accepted`) | ✅ Status line only | /sync |
| Edit an ADR's **content** / supersede it | ❌ flags as stale | /architect |
| Reconcile the roadmap — for the **relevant workspace's** roadmap file only (not all of `docs/roadmap/`) — tick **any** completed sub-task from repo **evidence** (code, tests, hardening entry, AGENTS.md), advance status | ✅ corrects | /sync |
| Add / reorder features or sub-tasks in the roadmap | ❌ leaves alone | /roadmap |
| Overwrite or rewrite curated AGENTS.md prose | ❌ flags conflict instead | human |

The dividing line on creation is **context, not policy**: create only when this change shows you the whole area; defer to /audit when the area predates the change and you've seen only a slice. When unsure, **flag instead of creating**.

## Asks vs acts

**Acts.** It scopes the change from git, applies conservative AGENTS.md updates, reconciles each linked ADR's Status line, flags stale ADRs, and reports. It pauses only when there is **nothing to sync** (empty change set). Because it edits curated files, every edit it makes is listed in the report so you can review or revert.

## Artifact ownership

Maintains root `AGENTS.md` and existing nested `<area>/AGENTS.md`; **creates** nested `<area>/AGENTS.md` only for an area net-new in this change (never creates or restructures root — that's /audit). Also **reconciles the roadmap** — scoped to the **relevant workspace's** roadmap file for the shipped change, not every file under `docs/roadmap/` — as the **universal sub-task reconciler** (it ticks any sub-task it can verify from repo evidence, sweeping the `/test`/`/harden`/`/audit`/`/sync` sub-tasks other skills don't tick, and advances feature status), and **reconciles each linked ADR's `**Status**:` line** to that feature's roadmap status. It never adds/removes/reorders features or sub-tasks, never edits ADR content, and writes nothing else — see `agent-prompt.md` for the exact evidence, mapping, standalone-ADR, and idempotency rules.

**Artifact base.** The ADRs and roadmap it reads/reconciles live under `docs/` by default, or `.workflow/` if `docs/` is a published docs site. **Use whichever base — `docs/` or `.workflow/` — exists in the repo** (paths here assume `docs/`).

## Portability (any OS, any agent)

Written for any Agent Skills client on macOS, Linux, or Windows:
- **Commands**: `git` is the only required CLI and behaves the same on every OS — run the `git` lines as shown. Other shell snippets are POSIX **reference**, not literal scripts: don't assume `find`, `grep`, `sed`, `cat`, `test`/`[ ]`, `ls`, or `xargs` exist. Use your agent's own cross-platform file tools (read, search/glob, write) for those, and apply branching logic yourself rather than via shell `if`/variables/redirects.
- **Bundled files**: referenced by paths relative to this skill's folder; the main agent reads them. Anything a subagent needs is passed **into its prompt as text** — subagents can't resolve skill-relative paths.
- **No subagent support?** The maintenance normally runs in a subagent on a fast, low-cost model. On a tool without one, do the AGENTS.md updates, roadmap/ADR-Status reconciliation, and ADR-staleness checks inline yourself, following the exact rules in **`agent-prompt.md`** (they are the authoritative rules for both the subagent and this inline path).

## Execution

### 1. Scope the change set (cheap — with per-file status)

**Freshness first (teams):** `git fetch --quiet`; if you're behind `origin/$BASE` (`git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/$BASE` > 0), warn the engineer to pull before syncing — a teammate may have already synced these docs, and reconciling against a stale tree creates conflicting edits.

Use `--name-status` (not `--name-only`) so the subagent can tell **A**dded from **M**odified from **D**eleted — the net-new-area and orphan-cleanup logic both depend on it.

Pick the base branch: use `main` if `git rev-parse --verify main` succeeds, otherwise `master`. Read the current branch with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.

- **If the current branch *is* the base** (mode `uncommitted`): get the changed files with `git diff --name-status HEAD`, then list untracked files with `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` and treat each as **A**dded (prefix them with an `A` status, matching the `--name-status` format).
- **Otherwise** (mode `branch`): compute the merge base with `git merge-base "$BASE" HEAD`, get the changed files with `git diff --name-status <merge-base>`, then list untracked files with `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` and treat each as **A**dded, as above.

Note the mode, base, and merge base for the subagent.

De-duplicate. Then **filter the list to source files** the subagent should sync *from*:
- **Drop documentation and config**: `AGENTS.md` (any level), `docs/**` (ADRs, reviews, etc.), `*.md`, `test-preferences.json`, lock files, generated output. /sync reads these as *targets/context*, never as the source of a change to record — syncing a doc from a doc is noise.
- **Drop test files** (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/`, etc.) — tests aren't durable area conventions.
- **Keep the `D` (deleted) entries** in a separate list — they drive orphan cleanup (Step 3), even though they aren't synced *from*.

**If no source files remain** (only docs/tests/config changed), stop — nothing to sync. Do not spawn.

### 2. Locate the context files and ADRs (paths only — do NOT read them here)

Using your agent's file-search/glob tools:
- Note whether a root `AGENTS.md` exists.
- Find every `AGENTS.md` (root + nested), excluding `node_modules/` and `.git/`.
- Find all ADRs under `docs/adr/` whose names start with a digit, sorted.
- Find the feature roadmap file for the shipped change — **scope to the relevant workspace's roadmap**, not every file under `docs/roadmap/`. In a monorepo, a changed file's workspace (`apps/<x>/…`) selects `docs/roadmap/<x>/`; pass only the roadmap file(s) whose workspace/features the diff actually touches. Don't read or pass all of `docs/roadmap/`.

The subagent reads these itself. The main model passes the **paths** (plus the changed-file list and diff command). The one inline exception is root AGENTS.md contents — short and useful for the subagent to anchor on.

For each changed file, note its nearest enclosing directory that has a `AGENTS.md` (root or nested) — that's the context file most likely to need an update.

### 3. Spawn the subagent

Read `agent-prompt.md`, fill it, then spawn a subagent with:

- Model: a fast, low-cost model (cheap — this is bounded maintenance, not open-ended reasoning)
- Description: "Sync: update AGENTS.md + flag stale ADRs"
- Tools: `Read`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Edit`, `Write` — `Edit` for maintaining existing docs, reconciling the roadmap, and reconciling ADR `**Status**:` lines; `Write` strictly for a **net-new-area** nested AGENTS.md. The "no root creation / no ADR *content* edits (Status line only) / no shallow nested docs for established areas" boundaries are rule-based (in the agent prompt), since the tool grant alone can't express them.
- Prompt: filled template with:
  1. Diff scope: `MODE`, `BASE`, `MERGE_BASE`, the **name-status** changed-source list + exact `git diff` command
  2. The separate **deleted-paths** list (for orphan cleanup)
  3. Root AGENTS.md contents (inline) + the list of nested AGENTS.md paths
  4. The full ADR path list (for both Status-line reconciliation and staleness flagging)
  5. The map of changed files → nearest context file
  6. The roadmap file path(s) for the **relevant workspace(s)** the diff touches — not all of `docs/roadmap/` — for reconciliation and as the source of each linked feature's status for ADR Status-line reconciliation

### 4. Relay the result

**If the subagent errored or returned no parseable summary**, report that and offer to re-run — don't fabricate a result (a genuine `NOTHING_TO_SYNC` is a valid success; a crash or empty output is not). Otherwise relay the compact summary:

```
## /sync complete

**Scope**: <N> changed files

**AGENTS.md updated**:
- `<path>`, <what was added/corrected, one line>   (or "no updates needed")

**AGENTS.md created** (new area):
- `<area>/AGENTS.md`, <what conventions it captures> (+ root pointer added)

**Orphans cleaned** (after deletions):
- `<path>`, <removed orphaned nested doc / fixed broken pointer>

**Roadmap reconciled** (relevant workspace):
- `<feature>`, <ticked sub-tasks / status planned→in-progress→done to match the diff>   (or "no roadmap, or already accurate")

**ADR statuses reconciled** (Status line only):
- `docs/adr/<file>`, <Status Proposed→In Progress→Accepted to match the feature's roadmap status>

**ADRs flagged stale** (run /architect to update or supersede):
- `docs/adr/<file>`, <why the change makes it stale, or status mismatch sync couldn't safely resolve>

**Context gaps** (run /audit, area too established for /sync to document from the diff alone):
- `<area>`, <pre-existing undocumented area only sliced by this change>

**Conflicts left for you** (not auto-edited):
- `<path>`, <curated content that would need rewriting; decide manually>
```

Omit any section with no items. If everything was already current and nothing is stale, say so in one line. /sync does not run /architect or /audit for you — it points; you decide.
